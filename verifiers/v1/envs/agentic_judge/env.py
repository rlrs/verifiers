"""Agentic judging: a solver plays the task, then a judge verifies the work.

Two reusable envs share the grading protocol. `--env.id agentic-judge` provisions
a fresh box from the solver's runtime policy and restores only the task's collected
artifacts; `--env.id shared-agentic-judge` explicitly runs the judge in the
solver's box. The judge grades rubric criteria (`[env.task]`: policy prompt,
criteria file) and writes its verdicts to `/tmp/verdict.json`, with the solver's
full trace record uploaded at `/tmp/trace.json`. `finalize()` validates them
strictly onto the solver's trace — `judge/<name>` metrics plus a weighted-mean
`judge` reward, composed with the taskset's own rewards via `[env.score]`
(judge-only by default).

The environment id selects the runtime boundary; there is no mode boolean whose
value can disagree with the environment's security and artifact semantics.
