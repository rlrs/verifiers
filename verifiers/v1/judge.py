"""A reusable per-task LLM judge for v1 tasksets.

Most tasksets that can't grade deterministically reach for the same shape: an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint, a prompt built from `(question, answer, response)`, one chat call, and a verdict parsed
out of the reply. `Judge` centralizes that — the client construction (incl. the Prime key/team
fallback), the call, and usage/cost capture — and leaves the two things that actually differ as
hooks: `build_messages` (prompt setup) and `parse`
(verdict parsing). Set `schema` to use OpenAI structured outputs (where the provider supports it),
in which case `JudgeResponse.parsed` is the validated pydantic object.

    class CorrectnessJudge(vf.Judge[bool]):
        prompt = "Question: {question}\\nAnswer: {answer}\\nResponse: {response}\\nCorrect? yes/no"

        def parse(self, response: vf.JudgeResponse[bool]) -> bool:
            return response.text.strip().lower().startswith("yes")

    class MyData(vf.TaskData):
        answer: str

    class MyTask(vf.Task[MyData, vf.State, MyConfig]):
        @vf.reward
        async def correct(self, trace) -> float:
            judge = CorrectnessJudge(self.config.judge)  # config.judge: vf.JudgeConfig
            result = await judge.evaluate(
                trace=trace,
                question=self.data.prompt_text,
                answer=self.data.answer,
                response=...,
            )
            return float(result.parsed)

A judge is cheap to construct (the HTTP client is opened per call, inside `complete`, and
closed when the call returns), so build it where you use it.

Passing `trace=` records the call onto it — a request/response record appended to
`trace.info["judge_calls"]` and
the call's tokens + cost added to `trace.extra_usage` (kept separate from the agent's `trace.usage`),
so judge behaviour and spend are no longer invisible. The record lands even if the judge refuses, an
empty structured output comes back, or `parse` raises (the request was already billed). Omit `trace`
for a pure call (e.g. in tests).

A judge can also be *plugged* rather than called from task code: a judge with an `id` and a
`score` implementation is a plugin (like a taskset or harness — see `verifiers.v1.judges` for the
built-ins and `verifiers.v1.utils.loaders` for resolution). Its config lives on `TaskConfig.judges`
only — judges are config, never row data (`--taskset.task.judges`; a taskset config may
pre-plug them as class defaults) — and `Task.score` builds and runs it after the task's own
`@reward`s.
