"""The GEPA <-> v1 bridge: run a candidate system prompt over a batch of tasks and score it.

GEPA's adapter protocol (`evaluate`, `make_reflective_dataset`) is synchronous and
`gepa.api.optimize` blocks, but v1 rollouts are async. The runner keeps the whole thing on one
event loop: it holds `env.serving()` open with a normal `async with` and runs the blocking
`optimize()` in a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`), so the loop stays free to drive rollouts.
Each synchronous `evaluate()` (called from that worker thread) submits its batch back to the
loop with `run_coroutine_threadsafe` and blocks on the result — the one sync↔async hop.
