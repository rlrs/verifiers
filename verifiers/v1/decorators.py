"""Decorators that program rollout control flow + scoring.

Each decorator just tags a method with attributes; `discover_decorated` collects
the tagged bound methods, sorted by descending priority then name.

Scoring methods declare the inputs they need *by parameter name* and the framework
injects them (`invoke`) — so a pure-trace reward needn't take the runtime, and an
in-runtime verifier needn't take the trace. The available names are:

    @reward / @metric  (per rollout):  task, trace, runtime
    @group_reward      (per group):    task, traces

All handlers must be `async`. Examples (on a Taskset subclass):

    @vf.reward(weight=1.0)
    async def correct(self, task, trace, runtime) -> float: ...   # all three

    @vf.metric
    async def turns(self, trace) -> float: ...                    # trace only

    @vf.group_reward
    async def most_concise(self, traces) -> list[float]: ...      # compares a task's rollouts

A `@group_reward` compares trace metadata across a task's rollouts; anything from the
runtime is recorded per rollout as a `@metric` first.
