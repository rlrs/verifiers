"""Explicit executable agents.

An `Agent` is the reusable execution primitive under evals, topologies, and plain agent
programs: harness + model context + runtime policy, with one arrow, `run(task) -> Trace`.
Topologies add graph recording and deferred rewards around that arrow; the agent itself
only knows how to execute one task.

A bare agent is fully standalone — each `run` provisions a runtime from the policy and
brings up its own per-rollout interception server, right for scripts and small programs:

    agent = vf.Agent(DirectHarness(DirectHarnessConfig()), ctx)
    trace = await agent.run(MyTask(vf.TaskData(idx=0, prompt="...")))

Serving resources have exactly one owner: `RunServices` (interception pools). For pooled
operation (N concurrent runs sharing interception servers, like an eval), enter a scope
and inject it — `async with RunServices() as services: Agent(..., services=services)` —
which is precisely what `TopologyRunner.serving` does for every agent it binds. The agent
never owns services; it borrows them. Taskset-scoped shared tool servers likewise arrive
pre-served (`shared_tools=`, see `serve_shared`), from whoever owns the taskset.

The framework's config-driven packaging of agents — CLI/toml-addressable, persisted as
agent graphs, eval- and trainer-integrated — is the topology (`verifiers.v1.topology`);
reach for a bare `Agent` when you're scripting.
