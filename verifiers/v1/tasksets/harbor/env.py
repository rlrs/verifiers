"""The harbor taskset's own env: the single solver seat, plus separate-verifier
grading for tasks that declare ``[verifier].environment_mode = "separate"``.

The default env for harbor runs (the taskset package exports it). A shared-verifier
task runs exactly as under the single-agent env: one `agent` trace, graded in the
box it worked in. A separate-verifier task is graded by `finalize` instead: the
solver's declared artifacts travel (collected by its task `finalize` while its box
is alive), a fresh box is provisioned from the task's verifier declaration,
`tests/` is staged there, and the verifier's rewards land on the solver's trace.
No second agent is involved — the verifier is the task's own `tests/test.sh`.
