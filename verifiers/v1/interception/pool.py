"""A pool of shared interception servers, grown on demand, so N concurrent rollouts need
~N/multiplex servers + tunnels rather than one each.

Behind a remote runtime each rollout's interception endpoint needs a tunnel, and tunnel
creation is rate-capped per API token — so one-tunnel-per-rollout caps how wide a remote
eval (or env server) can fan out. Each shared `InterceptionServer` serves up to `multiplex`
rollouts behind one tunnel (created via a host-side exposer runtime of the harness's runtime
type). The pool is elastic: `acquire` reuses a server with a free slot, else brings up a new
one — so it fits both the bounded eval runner and the env server's unbounded request load.
The harness is unchanged: it authenticates with a per-rollout secret, which is what the
server routes by.
