"""The Tunnel contract: expose a host interception port to a remote consumer.

The interception server runs on the host. Local runtimes use a host-local URL directly or
through their runtime translation; remote runtimes need the port published outward. A
`Tunnel` supplies the bind address and exposes that host port as a public URL. It is the
host-side counterpart to `Runtime.expose`, which publishes a port inside a sandbox.
