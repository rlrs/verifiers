# The Env

An `Env` defines the control flow between `Agents`. In the simplest case, it is just a `SingleAgentEnv` where a single agent solves a task from a taskset.

Its core signature is `Env.run(task: Task, agents: Agents)` -> None — it is passed an initial task and pre-initialized agents and then programs the full multi-agent control flow; every finished agent run automatically joins the resulting `Episode`, which holds all the traces of all the agents.

```python
class Env(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def run(self, task: Task, agents: Agents) -> None:
        """Run a single multi-agent episode."""
        ...
```

verifiers comes with different pre-built `Env`s to use:

- `IsolatedVerifierEnv` runs one solver, transfers only declared artifacts into a
  fresh configured runtime, and runs deterministic task scoring there.
- The `AgenticJudgeEnv` defines the sequential interaction between a solver and judge agent. The judge can re-use the same runtime after the solver (`SharedAgenticJudgeEnv`) or use its own, new runtime `IsolatedAgenticJudgeEnv`.
- The `UserSimEnv` models users as agents, and the episode is a turn-by-turn conversation between the user and assistant agents.
- The `BestOfNEnv` runs n independent attempts at the same task, then marks which attempt achieved the highest reward (best) and whether any attempt crossed a success threshold (pass_at_n), which is useful for rejection sampling and pass@k evaluation.

## Isolated deterministic verification

Select `--env.id isolated-verifier` when the task's score must not run in the
solver's sandbox. It is still a one-agent run: the environment records one solver
trace and starts no verifier agent, model, or harness.

```bash
uv run eval my-task --env.id isolated-verifier --env.agent.runtime.type docker
```

Task authors use the existing task API. Declare every solver output the verifier
needs in `TaskData.artifacts`, then implement deterministic `@vf.reward` and
`@vf.metric` methods. A runtime parameter makes the fresh verifier box available:

```python
from pathlib import Path

import verifiers.v1 as vf


PRIVATE_TESTS = Path("tests/test_solution.sh").read_bytes()


class CodeTask(vf.Task[CodeData]):
    async def stage_verifier(self, runtime: vf.Runtime) -> None:
        await runtime.write("/tmp/test_solution.sh", PRIVATE_TESTS)

    @vf.reward
    async def tests(self, runtime: vf.Runtime) -> float:
        result = await runtime.run(["bash", "/tmp/test_solution.sh"], {})
        return float(result.exit_code == 0)


task = CodeTask(
    CodeData(
        prompt="Fix the implementation.",
        artifacts=[vf.Artifact(source="src")],
    )
)
```

The lifecycle is fixed:

1. The task and harness run normally, including task `finalize` and harness metrics,
   but task metrics and rewards are deferred.
2. The environment collects the declared paths and `/logs/artifacts`, then destroys
   the solver runtime.
3. It creates a fresh task controller and provisions either the same resolved
   container/runtime policy or the independently configured verifier runtime, runs
   task `setup`, restores the artifacts at their original paths, runs task
   `stage_verifier`, reapplies the execution network policy, and runs task metrics
   and rewards onto the solver trace.

The verifier runtime must be Docker, Prime, or another container runtime; absolute
artifact restoration is intentionally refused on the host subprocess runtime.
By default the verifier uses the solver's resolved runtime policy. Set
`--env.verifier.runtime.*` to independently choose its runtime type, image, resources,
and network policy; `--env.verifier.env` can independently set its process environment.
Relative artifacts require matching solver and verifier workdirs because artifacts are
restored without path translation; absolute artifacts permit different workdirs.
Configured model-backed task judges are rejected: use deterministic metrics/rewards
here, or an agentic/judge environment when a model must judge the result.
`--env.verifier.retries` retries fresh verifier attempts after setup, restoration,
staging, or scoring failures (default: 2).
