# Overview

verifiers is our library for creating environments to train and evaluate LLMs.

verifiers is tightly integrated with the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), as well as our training framework [prime-rl](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) and our [Hosted Training](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/training) platform.

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Prime CLI](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime) to interact with the environments.

```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# install the prime CLI
uv tool install prime
```

## Further reading

- The [docs](docs/) contain short, human-written guides and overviews about the architecture.
- The [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [skills](skills/) are for coding agents and go into more details.

For restricted-network interception, a synthetic user notice is anchored after
leading system/developer instructions when no user message exists. Keep this
placement stable and idempotent across turns to preserve prompt-prefix caching;
provider-side capability restrictions are enforced separately.
